Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- **Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?**

     - moveIn(String name): To allow adding a resident by their name without requiring a Student object. This makes the method more flexible and user-friendly.
     - moveOut(String name, boolean notify): To allow removing a resident by their name with an option to notify them. This provides additional functionality for managing residents.
      - sellCoffee(int size, int nSugarPackets, int nCreams, boolean isTakeaway): To handle takeaway orders.
     - restock(int nCoffeeOunces, int nSugarPackets, int nCreams): To allow partial restocking of specific items.
     addTitle(String title, boolean isAvailable): To allow adding books with a specified availability status.
     - checkOut(String title, int days): To specify the number of days a book is borrowed.

- **What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?**

Overloading methods allowed us to provide more flexible and intuitive functionality for each class. It was challenging to make sure that overloaded methods didnâ€™t conflict with existing methods or introduce ambiguity. I reccommend future students to plan class design carefully and think about how overloaded methods will improve usability without overcomplicating the code.
